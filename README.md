# Advent of Code 2025

### How to run

Run from the project root and use flags to select day, part and dataset.

`go run . -d 12 -p 2 -s 1`

`-d` or `-day` to select the day, from 1 to 25

`-p` or `-puzzle` to select the first or second puzzle, expects 1 or 2 (defaults to 1)

`-s` or `-sample` to select sample data, expects 1+ (most days only have 1 sample dataset, some have more) - omit this flag to run on the full dataset

### Disclaimers

I am learning Go, from a background of PHP/WordPress/web development. I mostly tried to solve these problems on my own, therefore they don't necessarily represent the best possible ways to solve, or idiomatic Go code, as I am still learning. Where I have looked for help for others on the Reddit I have made comments in the code to give credit and thanks to those individuals for sharing their solutions.

##### Day 9

At the time of writing I have not yet solved part 2 of day 9 - moving on to come back to it later!
